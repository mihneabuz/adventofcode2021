Haskell solutions

-- Conclusions --
Doing Haskell this year was very fun.
I still have a lot to learn, but I am really liking haskell.

It was a very robust and mostly bug-free experience which was a great
improvement over last year in python.

Some challanges ware very hard to optimize, especially the 2d map ones
involving convolutions or searches.

The recursive solutions felt amazing to write and were very fast.
